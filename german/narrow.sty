% Use "listings" package.  This lets us have automatic line breaking.

  basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,      % print size
  breaklines=true,                        % sets automatic line breaking

}

% Override definition of "verbatim" with a "listings" block.
% Reasons:
% 1. This provides *useful* text highlighting.
%    Text editors like vim know about verbatim, but not listings, so
%    directly replacing "\begin{verbatim" with "\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]"
%    causes *all* text highlighting to go wrong once verbatim is
%    first used.
% 2. We really only need listings for the narrow case, so let's only
%    override it in that case.
% 3. This eliminates the need to change many lines in the .tex file.
%    That's not a *big* deal, but it's a minor bonus.
